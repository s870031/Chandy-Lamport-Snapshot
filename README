-----------------
Author: Hsin-Hua Chen
Date: 7/5/2016

Files/Folders:
1. src/: Source code folder
         files: Project1.java, Node.java, ConfigReader.java, Message.java,
		        SpanningTree.java, CLProtocol.java
2. bin/: Class folder
3. launcher.sh: Launch "Project1" on remote device according to config file
4. Cleanup.sh: kill all processes on remote device according to config file
5. Compile.sh: run compile script

Compiling instructions:
1. Let configuration file, launcher script, cleanup script, 
   src folder, bin folder in the same directory.
2. Run command "javac -d bin src/*" or simply run compile.sh it will create
   Byte code in bin folder.

Running instruction:
1. Run launcher.sh with configuration file as parameter:
        sh launcher.sh [Configuration File Name]
2. To End program, Run cleanup.sh with config file as parameter:
        sh cleanup.sh [Configuation File Name]

Output:
   After running the program, it will generate output files named 
   "config-<nodeid>.out" which shows the timestamp of each snapshots.

[TODO]
1. implement save application message in queue.
2. node 0 check consistency
3. when testing, CL protocol seems can't run itself. Will provide null
   pointer error.
4. modify: implement  MAP protocol send message in class
